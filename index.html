            <h1>BEHAVIOUR</h1>
            <p>
                Chinchillas are largely nocturnal, which means they will be most active at night. Sometimes they are called "crepuscular," meaning their activity peaks at dawn and dusk. In any case, they should be kept in a fairly quiet area during the day. And while they are mostly quiet animals, their nighttime movements might keep some people awake if their enclosure is close to your bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must be gentle and consistent to gain the trust of a chinchilla. It can take some time to get a chinchilla used to your hands. And some chinchillas will never really like to be held much. They'd rather be exploring, or they might prefer to climb on you rather than being restrained. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinchillas are perhaps best known for their incredibly soft, thick, luxurious fur. In the wild, this fur protects them from the elements. But in captivity, it makes them somewhat susceptible to overheating. This must be considered when deciding where to place your chinchilla in the house. The temperature should remain between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. While chinchillas are tolerant to cold, heat stroke can occur in warmer temperatures.

                <h1>WHAT DO CHINCHILLAS EAT & DRINK?</h1>
            <p>Remember 3 main things:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>hay;</li> 
               <li>palleted food;</li>
               <li>water.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Chinchillas are herbivores and have specific dietary requirements. They require a lot of roughage, so their diet should mainly consist of good-quality grass hay.</p>
            <p>To supplement the hay, offer a commercial pelleted chinchilla food.</p>
            <p>Finally, always have fresh water available to your chinchilla.</p>
